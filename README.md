# Install TensorFlow

Welcome. For this workshop, you can do one of the following:

 1. [Install TensorFlow directly on your Mac.](install-mac-native.md)
*This is recommended*, as it installs the least amount on your computer
and will run the fastest.

 1. [Install TensorFlow directly on your Windows machine.](install-win-native.md)
*This is recommended*, as it installs the least amount on your computer
and will run the fastest.

 1. [Use Docker on Mac, running TensorFlow in a local
VM.](install-mac-docker.md) If for some reason you can't install
TensorFlow natively or already have Docker installed, you can try this.

 1. [Install TensorFlow directly on your Ubuntu/Linux
machine.](install-ubuntu.md)

If you run into trouble, our full install instructions are available on [tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org).

Strata folks, here are the [slides](https://goo.gl/AwmsrV). Thanks again.
