# Installation instructions

For this workshop, you may either install TensorFlow directly on your laptop, or use a Docker container running either locally, or on a Cloud-based VM. Please choose the option below that's right for you.

### Option 1: Install TensorFlow directly on your laptop
This approach is recommended if you prefer the smallest download.

1. [Install TensorFlow on Mac using a Virtual Environment.](setup/install-mac.md) 

1. [Install TensorFlow on Windows.](setup/install-win.md)

1. [Install TensorFlow on Ubuntu/Linux using a Virtual Environment.](setup/install-ubuntu.md)

If you're an experienced developer, you can find a pip requirements file [here](setup/requirements.txt).

### Option 2: Install TensorFlow using Docker

This approach is a good option if you have difficulty installing TensorFlow directly.

1. [Run the TensorFlow Docker image on your laptop.](setup/install-docker.md)

1. [Run the TensorFlow Docker image on a Cloud-based VM.](setup/install-cloud.md) This is a good option if you have difficulty using Docker on your laptop.
