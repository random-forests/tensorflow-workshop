# Sentiment Analysis Tutorial

This is the code and data used for the Sentiment Analysis Tutorial available
at [`tutorial.md`](tutorial.md)

In this tutorial we're going to show how to build a recurrent neural network
(RNN) that learns how to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using
TensorFlow high level APIs. Here, the focus is on introducing the high level APIs,
rather than on building a high-accuracy model.

## How to run this?

### Install TensorFlow

Go [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) for instructions.
**Make sure you have installed TensorFlow v1.2 or higher**

### Train your model

The first time you run the script can take a while to the model actually
starts training, since it will first download the files available at
[LSTM Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/adeshpande3/LSTM-Sentiment-Analysis)
where you can find a preprocessed version of the
[Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
and also a
[great sentiment analysis tutorial using low-level TensorFlow by Oâ€™Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/perform-sentiment-analysis-with-lstms-using-tensorflow).

To start you can run the `sentiment_analysis.py` file. There are
a number of different arguments you can try in order to produce different models
so we encourage you to have a look on the code to see all you can do.

Below are some examples of what you can change in the model just using arguments.

```shell

# Train the model, then evaluate and predict using the default model,
# will save the output at "sentiment_analysis_output".
# The default model is a single LSTM layer with 128 cells
# and a dense softmax layer on top of the last cell.
# This was the \same command used to train the the model mentioned in
# the tutorial.
$ python sentiment_analysis.py

# Use the average of the hidden states as the final output for the RNN layers
# as suggested by "Sentiment Analysis with Deeply Learned Distributed
# Representations of Variable Length Texts" from James Hong and Michael Fang
# (2015) http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/HongJames.pdf.
# It will not run an experiment, instead it will use the estimator's
# interface to first train and then evaluate the model
# (this is the biggest difference of using/not using experiments in local
# settings).
$ python sentiment_analysis.py --use_hidden_states=average --dont_run_experiment

# Change the model to have 3 LSTM layers with dropout of 0.75, 0.5 and 0.5
# and add two DNN layers on top of the RNNs.
# It will train for 1 epoch
$ python sentiment_analysis.py --rnn_cell_sizes 128 128 64 \
                               --dropout_keep_probabilities 0.75 0.5 0.5 \
                               --dnn_layer_sizes 64 64 \
                               --model_dir "my_deep_rnn" \
                               --num_epochs 1

# There are more command line flags to play with; check sentiment_analysis.py
# for details.
```

### Using TensorBoard

Use this command during, or after training to visualize metrics,
the model graph, and more.
```shell
# Set --log_dir to point to the model_dir of the previous step
# by default the model_dir is "sentiment_analysis_output"
$ tensorboard --log_dir="sentiment_analysis_output"
```

You can also check your TensorFlow graph to debug your graph if needed.

### Prediction sample output

In the sentences below *unk* stands for a word that isn't in the word
embedding. The *0 0 ... 0* in some lines means that the line was padded
with zeros in the end so it could have length equals to 250 (more details
about this in the tutorial).

The model outputs a 2-dim tensor as result containing the probability
of a review be negative (index 0) or positive (index 1)

there isnt much that comes close to the unk storytelling and suspenseful unk levels as goldeneye when it came out it was the greatest game of alltime and even today it stays strong i will admit that this game did get boring after a few months of playing and by not playing it again until two years later i was thrust back into its greatest almost as if i was playing it for the first time again there are 20 unk levels which is probably the most of any james bond game to date probably the most unforgettable one is the tank level which was likely the most explosive video game sequence at that time and the unk shooting as well as usage of q gadgets is what james bond fans are always dying to use frankly as a james bond fan i look for aspects of a true james bond experience which are now showing up in the ps2 games so this game while it has some great action and usable gadgets i was somewhat expecting a little more even back in 1997 i also disliked that this game didnt have q or m or moneypenny or anyone from mi6 while watching the movies bond interacts with these characters at least a few times throughout each movie but they are nowhere to be seen in this game and vocal dialogue would have made the game more lively rather than the text dialogue they wound up using they had the

## Done training? Play with your model!

Make sure you pass the same arguments to *sentiment_analysis.py*
and *sentiment_analysis.py --mode=classify* since in the *classify mode*
the script will load the model trained in the `model_dir` so make sure
you're running the same model.

**Only lower case letters and numbers are accepted as input.**

```shell
# The script will load your model and you can use it to classify new sentences
$ python sentiment_analysis.py --mode=classify --model_dir="sentiment_analysis_output"
```

## Whats next?

In this tutorial we showed how to implement a Recurrent Neural Network for
binary sentiment analysis using TensorFlow high level APIs.

* We encourage you to run the code and see how the model performs for yourself.
  The model parameters were not tuned, so a good exercise is just play with
  the parameters and in order to have better results.
  Try changing the learning rate, optimizer, hidden state size,
  number of RNN cells, number of DNN layers, and so on.

* Finally, the model presented above can be easily changed to be used on
  different data and even perform different classification
  or prediction tasks. A great example of how to change this implementation to
  perform different tasks is [colorbot](https://github.com/random-forests/tensorflow-workshop/blob/master/extras/colorbot/)
  a deep RNN model that receives a word (sequence of characters) as input
  and learns to predict a rgb value that better represents this word.
  As a result we have a color generator!
